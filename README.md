# Passive-Fingerprinting-of-Same-Model-Electrical-Devices-by-Current-Consumption
One of the possible device authentication methods is based on device fingerprints, such as software- or hardware-based unique characteristics. In this paper, we propose a fingerprinting technique based on passive externally measured information, i.e. current consumption from the electrical network. The key insight is that small hardware discrepancies naturally exist even between same-electrical-circuit devices, making it feasible to identify small variations in the consumed current.  An experimental database of current consumption signals was collected. The resulting signals we classified within several modern time series classification methods, including \texttt{tsfel}, deep neural network (DNN), ROCKET and empirical wavelet decomposition-based manual feature extraction technique. We have successfully identified 40 similar (same-model) electrical devices with about 94\% precision.
